# Installation
1. Install the macro/keybind mod to the Westeros Craft Launcher (as described in this thread)[https://forum.westeroscraft.com/threads/how-to-install-the-macro-keybind-mod-in-1-12-2.2486/#post-18149].
2. Navigate to .westeroscraft\instances\WesterosCraft-1.12.2\liteconfig\common and replace the contents of macro folder with the contents of this repository.

# Use
1. Start the game.
2. Go to 'Controls' and in the section 'Macro/Keybind Mod' configure your 'Macro activate' key. For me it's the GRAVE key (`). 
3. Join the server.
4. Hit the 'Macro activate' key to access the macro GUI.
5. All these macros operate on a world edit selection.
